# Politics & War Modern UI - Dark/Purple Themes

This repository contains Tampermonkey user scripts designed to give Politics & War a highly modernized, card-based dark theme, with improved readability and visual consistency.

## Themes

  * **Dark Color Scheme:** Easy on the eyes, especially during extended gameplay.
  * **Card-Based Layout:** Modernized design for information blocks and tables.
  * **Improved Readability:** Enhanced font choices and spacing.
  * **Consistent Design:** A cohesive look across various pages of the game.


### Sidebar/Resource/Project Page (Working On)
